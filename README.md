# danger.systems
The website generator for danger.systems, which was staticly generated to gh-pages

---

So, check it out, as Danger supports things like Github, GitLab and BitBucket, we felt
like it was a good move to start separating out our repos(repositories) across the platforms.

Especially as GitLab repos seems well oriented towards building static sites. 

What does this mean? Well, the repo for http://danger.systems is actually at:

https://gitlab.com/danger-systems/danger.systems

So please do not send PRs to this repo, send MRs! to ^ :D
