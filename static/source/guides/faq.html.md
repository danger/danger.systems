#### Can I run Danger on my computer to test?

Yep! Use `danger local`. If you want to get into a debug REPL, use `danger local --pry`. You can find more on the [troubleshooting guide]()

#### I want to ignore a fail, just this once

You can tell Danger to ignore a specific warning or error by commenting on the body of your code review body:

```
> Danger: Ignore "Developer Specific file shouldn't be changed"
```

Then Danger would not show that message, and would not fail the build if it were the only `fail`.

#### I use GitLab

There's a [Work in Progress PR](https://github.com/danger/danger/pull/299) - the blockers are a bit out of our control though.

#### I have to use GitHub Enterprise, which is always outdated :(

You can work with GitHub Enterprise by setting 2 environment variables:

- `DANGER_GITHUB_HOST` to the host that GitHub is running on.
- `DANGER_GITHUB_API_HOST` to the host that the GitHub Enterprise API is reachable on. After 3.0
  the preferred name for this variable is `DANGER_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL`, however `DANGER_GITHUB_API_HOST`
  will still work.

This could look like:

```
DANGER_GITHUB_API_HOST=https://git.corp.evilcorp.com/api/v3 DANGER_GITHUB_HOST=git.corp.evilcorp.com bundle exec danger
```

and after 3.0:

```
DANGER_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL=https://git.corp.evilcorp.com/api/v3 DANGER_GITHUB_HOST=git.corp.evilcorp.com bundle exec danger
```

#### I want to run Danger across multiple repos

To have consistent rules across the repos in your organisation, you can use a shared `Dangerfile`:

1. create a repo on your GitHub organization called `danger` (or `Danger`)
1. Add a `Dangerfile` to the root of that repo
1. The new `Dangerfile` is ran after the current repo's `Dangerfile`

The org `Dangerfile` will have access to all of the same plugins, and metadata as your current . For an example, see [themoji/danger](https://github.com/Themoji/danger).

#### Multiple Dangers

You can have each instance of Danger running on a different CI provider and even doing different validations. An use case would be:

* `basic` runs on a Linux environment (such as Circle CI) and validates the PR itself (title, etc)
* `compilation` runs on a Mac after running unit tests for your iOS app and comments about warnings, test failures, etc
* `uitests` runs on a Mac after running UI Unit tests and comments about test failures

``` sh
bundle exec danger --danger_id=unit_tests
```

#### I use a Build Matrix on Travis, can I run Danger once?

Yep, here is an example of moving to support that from [the Ruby Grape project](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/pull/1458).

#### Danger keeps getting refered to as "her/she", what gives?

When we were in the naming process of Danger, we went through a lot of names. In the end, it got named after Gem "Danger" McShane, who was involved in both the copy and the concept. While not a programmer herself, she's helped out with trying to understand the personality behind the project. Danger, the project, is a female, northern UK, command-line app into 80's punk/indie. Inspired by community efforts [like the Ha√ßienda / Factory Records][hacienda].

Understandably, applying a gender to a genderless concept comes with it's own complications. To make it worse, female genders tend to be applied towards "[digital assistants][assistants]" which should raise questions on outdated-but-still-persisting gender stereotypes and patriarchical power structures. There is no answer that can completely absolve the disconnect I'm afraid.
